  * *interpreting symbols and codes that provide information (for example, map legends)*
  * *explaining what intangible boundaries mean or why they exist (for example, the equator as a division on a globe, out-of-bounds areas shown on a plan of the school)*

  * *connecting the feelings and behaviours of animals in anthropomorphic stories with human emotions and relationships*
* <span class="light">**English 2**: Discuss the characters and settings of different texts and explore how language is used to present these features in different ways (ACELT1591)</span>

  * *determining which questions will gather appropriate responses for a simple investigation*
* <span class="light">**HASS 2**: Pose questions about past and present objects, people, places and events (ACHASSI034)</span>
